We got married in April 2021 and are currently residing in Houston, TX. We do everything together from exploring different places around the city to sharing food while we watch television. She's extremely smart, a pleasure to be around, and has helped me improve in so many areas in my life.",

Every move I make, I make sure to seek their advice and counsel. They've molded me to who I am today and they are the best parents I could ever ask for. Even though they're on the other side of the country, I think of them every single day. I am so grateful for them and love them so much.",

      "Kix N Play is a sneaker reselling business I started at the end of 2021 that merges my 2 favorite passions together: NBA 2K and sneakers. What separates me from the average reseller is that I'm selling sneakers at below-market prices if you beat me in NBA 2K. So if you're sneakerhead and think you can beat me in 2K, head to Kix N Play's Instagram page now to see what's available. Thank you in advance for supporting my business.",

      "As I continue to be unapologetically Black, I believe it is important to let my voice be heard during these trying times. It's disheartening that people consciously refuse to understand the phrase 'Black lives matter.' It's not saying that our lives are greater than any other race; it's simply an outcry to the blatant racial injustices, profiling, marginalizing, and oppression that WE endure on the daily. Even through it all, I am PROUD to be Black and will not hold my tongue to express it ‚úäüèæ.",

His music helped ease my anxiety of moving here in the fashion we did and also helped me become more comfortable to call this place "home". Nipsey helped me see L.A. in a different light from what I saw on television. He also inspired me to stay dedicated to reach my goals and to keep striving because my hard work WILL pay off in the long run. Thank you Nipsey, The Marathon Continues üèÅ.',

I'm pretty good at it I would think but that's another conversation. Basketball taught me discipline and gave me confidence to strive to be the best at any and everything I do. Well since you asked, my top 5 favorite players of all-time are LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Shaq, and the late-great Kobe Bryant. Rest in peace Kobe & Gianna. Mamba Forever.",

      "Two of the biggest reasons why I am passionate about technology is because of the ever-evolving capabilities of technology and the reward of producing quality products. Technology is without a doubt one of the most significant entities in our modern lives. I've always been attracted to how the IoT, such as computers and mobile phones, work behind the scenes. That solely drove me to learn how to code and want to continue to be hands-on with the growing world of tech.",

I have developed a different outlook on it since moving here and I am more determined to be successful in my career. Even though it is a bit expensive to live in L.A., it is definitely a place I can see myself settling and raising a family.',
